## Access mode decision table

Check what is actually available before assuming a mode.

| Available | Mode | How you read |
|---|---|---|
| Shell + repo path on disk | **Local clone** | `ls`, `find`, `rg`/`grep -n`, `sed -n`/`head`, read-only `git` |
| GitHub connector / MCP tools | **Connector** | Repo tree, file contents, commits, issues, PRs, CI runs via the tool |
| Web fetch only | **Web** | Fetch repo pages and raw file URLs; slower, so lean harder on targeted paths |
| None of the above | **Blocked** | Ask the user for a clone path or repo URL. Do not infer contents from the repo name. |

Modes combine. A local clone plus a connector lets you read working-tree state *and*
open PRs and CI results — say so in Sources examined when you use both.

State the mode in section 2 of the report. It tells the downstream agent what your
findings could and could not have covered — a connector read of `main` says nothing
about uncommitted local work.

## Repo acquisition

If the repo is named but not present locally and no connector is available, a **shallow
read-only clone into a scratch directory** is permitted purely as an acquisition step:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 <url> /tmp/scout-<name>
```

Constraints: never clone into or over an existing working tree; never `fetch`, `pull`,
`checkout`, or otherwise mutate afterward; disclose the clone in Sources examined. A
shallow clone gives you no meaningful history, so note that limitation if commit history
would have mattered.

If the user's environment forbids even this, ask rather than proceed blind.

## Permitted commands

Observation only — nothing that changes repo state, working tree, installed packages, or
build artifacts.

```
ls, tree, find, stat, wc, file
grep -n, rg -n, ag
cat (small files only), head, tail, sed -n '<start>,<end>p'
git log, git log --oneline --stat, git show, git diff (read of existing state),
git status, git ls-files, git blame, git rev-parse, git branch --list, git tag --list,
git remote -v
```

## Forbidden commands

Not exhaustive — the principle is that nothing you run may change anything.

```
git add / commit / checkout / switch / restore / merge / rebase / pull / fetch /
  push / stash / clean / reset / tag -a / branch -d
npm install / ci / run <anything>, yarn, pnpm, pip install, poetry install,
  cargo build / run, go build, make, just, gradle, mvn
pytest, jest, vitest, go test, cargo test — including "just to see if they pass"
black, prettier, eslint --fix, ruff --fix, gofmt -w, any formatter or codegen
mkdir, touch, rm, mv, cp, chmod, any shell redirection (>, >>, tee)
docker build / run, terraform plan / apply, any deployment or migration tool
```

Two specific traps:

- **Running the test suite.** Tempting, because it directly answers "what's passing?".
  It also mutates caches, `.pytest_cache`, coverage files, and sometimes fixtures.
  Instead, report the exact command the next agent should run, cite where it is defined
  (CI config, `Makefile`, npm scripts), and infer current state from CI history, badges,
  or skip/xfail markers.
- **Installing to inspect a dependency.** Read the lockfile and the manifest instead.

If the user explicitly authorizes a specific state-changing command, that overrides this
list for that command only — note the authorization in Sources examined.

## Evidence citation format

**Files:** `path/from/repo/root.ext:120-148` — always relative to the repo root, always
with a line range when the file is more than a few lines.

**Commands:** the command as run, then a summarized result.

```
$ rg -n "def verify_" --glob '*.py'
→ 3 definitions: src/gates/structure.py:44, src/gates/faithful.py:71, src/cli.py:210
```

**Connector or web reads:** name the tool or URL and what you retrieved
(`GitHub connector → workflows/ci.yml @ main`).

**Absence is evidence too**, and it needs a citation just as much as presence — cite the
search that came up empty:

```
$ rg -n "sufficiency" --glob '!node_modules'
→ no matches; DoD criterion 3 has no corresponding implementation or test
```

Do not cite line numbers you did not actually observe. A fabricated range is worse than
no citation, because the downstream agent will trust it.

## High-signal search patterns

Cheap searches that usually pay off early:

```bash
ls -a                                        # governance files, CI dir, config
rg -n "TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX" --glob '!node_modules'
rg -n "NotImplemented|pass  # stub|raise NotImplementedError|throw new Error\('not"
rg -n "@pytest.mark.(skip|xfail)|it.skip|test.skip|describe.skip|t.Skip"
git log --oneline -20                        # where work stopped
git log --oneline -10 --name-only            # which files are hot
find . -name "*.yml" -path "*workflow*"      # verification surface
rg -n "Definition of Done|DoD|Acceptance|acceptance criteria" -i
```

The pairing that most often produces the single best next path: recent commit history
(where work stopped) crossed with skip/stub markers (what was left undone) crossed with
the DoD criteria (what still has to be true).

## Structural localization patterns

Run these in Step 3, before opening source files. Substitute the symbol the DoD
objective turns on for `<name>`.

```bash
# where it is defined
rg -n "def <name>|class <name>|function <name>|const <name>|<name>\s*=" --glob '!node_modules'

# who calls or imports it (dependents)
rg -n "\b<name>\b" --glob '!node_modules' -l        # files, then narrow
rg -n "import.*<name>|from.*import.*<name>|require.*<name>"

# what it depends on — read the import block of the defining file
sed -n '1,40p' <defining-file>

# which tests or CI steps exercise it
rg -n "<name>" tests/ test/ spec/ 2>/dev/null
rg -n "<name>" .github/ Makefile justfile 2>/dev/null

# language-server alternative, when available: find-references on the symbol
# beats grep, because it resolves scope instead of matching text
```

Grep matches text, not scope — it over-matches on common names and misses
dynamic dispatch, reflection, and string-keyed lookups. When a name is generic,
narrow by path or file glob before widening. When a language server or
dependency-graph tool is available, prefer it and say so in Sources examined;
when it is not, say that too, because a grep-derived dependency picture has
known blind spots and the downstream agent should know which kind it got.

Read the located units complete. Reading half of a function to save tokens
produces a citation that looks grounded while the claim rests on lines you never
saw — the worst outcome available, worse than declining to make the claim.
